## Analyzing and Predicting Housing Market Trends using Supervised Machine Learning Models

### Project Overview

This project utilizes a dataset containing house sale prices in King County, including Seattle, from May 2014 to May 2015. It mirrors real-world real estate analysis, encouraging collaborative problem-solving and practical application of Python in real estate finance.

### Dataset Features

- **`id`**: A unique identifier for each house.
- **`date`**: The date when the house was sold.
- **`price`**: The sale price of the house (prediction target).
- **`bedrooms`**: Number of bedrooms in the house.
- **`bathrooms`**: Number of bathrooms in the house per bedroom.
- **`sqft_living`**: Square footage of the interior living space.
- **`sqft_lot`**: Square footage of the land space.
- **`floors`**: Number of floors (levels) in the house.
- **`waterfront`**: Indicates whether the house has a waterfront view.
- **`view`**: Number of times the house has been viewed.
- **`condition`**: Overall condition of the house.
- **`grade`**: Overall grade given to the house based on the King County grading system.
- **`sqft_above`**: Square footage of the house apart from the basement.
- **`sqft_basement`**: Square footage of the basement.
- **`yr_built`**: The year the house was built.
- **`yr_renovated`**: The year the house was renovated.
- **`zipcode`**: ZIP code area.
- **`lat`**: Latitude coordinate.
- **`long`**: Longitude coordinate.
- **`sqft_living15`**: Interior living space for the nearest 15 neighbors in 2015.
- **`sqft_lot15`**: Land space for the nearest 15 neighbors in 2015.

**Target column:** `Price` Our primary focus is to understand which features most significantly impact house prices. Additionally, we aim to explore properties valued at $650K and above for more detailed insights.

### Project Goal

The project goal is to analyze, clean the data, and test multiple supervised regression machine learning models. We aim to assess the results and decide which model predicts best.
